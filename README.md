I recently completed an internship with CodSoft, where I worked on several exciting web development projects. These included creating a responsive landing page, designing a personal portfolio, and developing a functional calculator. Each project allowed me to enhance my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and responsive design, while also providing valuable experience in problem-solving and user interface design. This internship has been a significant step in my career, preparing me for future challenges in the tech industry.
